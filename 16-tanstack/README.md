In this project, we will understand the use of the tanstack query or react query as it was known before. 

This is a react library that is used to manage your api state, fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server side more efficiently and effectively with minimal line of manual code. 

We can do the above stated functions even without this library, however, in that case we will have to use various states, side effects or such hooks to handle these things. 

However,this library make such operations very easier. Also it is great for server side rendering applications.
